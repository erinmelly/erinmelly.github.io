Hello! I am currently pursuing my Masters of Public Policy (MPP) from the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy at the University of Virginia. My areas of interest include the social safety net, domestic anti-poverty programs, and state and local budgeting. Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as an Economic Policy Research Associate at a think tank, where I aided research on paid family and medical leave, carbon taxation, economic mobility, and open-source micro-simulation modeling of tax policy. I received my B.A. in Economics and Sustainable Development from Columbia University.  Upon graduation from the Frank Batten School, I hope to use my skills to advocate for evidence-based, equitable policy analysis at the state and local level.


### My story

I was born and raised on Long Island, NY. I grew a quick love for athletics in high school, where I began to run cross country and track and field. In 2014, I was recruited to Columbia to run on their cross country and track and field team. Off of the track, I found a passion for social science research when I spent a summer in Menonomie, WI researching lake pollution and toxic algae blooms in the Red Cedar Watershed community. From there, I explored behavioral research about environmental value signaling in the workplace under the guidance of a professor at Columbia Business School. Upon graduation I accepted a position as a research assistant at a DC think tank doing econonomic policy work. Here I gained invaluable quantitative skills and was able to work on an incredible biparisan initiative advocating for a national paid family and medical leave plan. I also worked on research regarding many facets of tax policy, including advocating for a carbon tax, and expansion of the EITC and CTC.

In 2020 I decided to pursue my MPP at Batten in order to deepen my analysis skills, gain leadership tools and explore opportunities at advocating for progressive, evidence-based, equitable policies at the state and local level.

So, here I am! In my free time, I enjoy running, crosswording, tutoring first graders in my area, and eating dessert.
