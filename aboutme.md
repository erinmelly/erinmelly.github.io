Hello! I am currently pursuing my Masters of Public Policy (MPP) at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy at the University of Virginia. My areas of interest include the social safety net and anti-poverty programs, environmental policy, and state and local budgeting. Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as an economic policy research associate, working on projects related to paid family and medical leave, carbon taxation, economic mobility, and open-source microsimulation modeling of tax policy. I received my B.A. in Economics and Sustainable Development from Columbia University. Upon graduation, I hope to use my skills to analyze and advocate for equitable, evidence-based, policy at the state and local level.

* Two of my most rewarding projects: 
  * Helping manage research advocating for paid family and medical leave policies
  * Working on a carbon tax paper that suggested additional tax reforms, such as EITC and CTC expansion, to help achieve both environmental and equity goals
