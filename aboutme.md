I am currently pursuing my Masters of Public Policy (MPP) at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy at the University of Virginia. My areas of interest include the social safety net and anti-poverty programs, environmental policy, and state and local budgeting. I received my B.A. in Economics and Sustainable Development from Columbia University. Upon graduation, I hope to use my skills to analyze and advocate for equitable, evidence-based, policy at the state and local level.


### Fun Facts

* In my free time, I enjoy running, crosswording and tutoring first graders.
* I can run a mile in 4:59.
* I found a passion for social science research when I spent a summer in Menonomie, WI researching lake pollution and toxic algae blooms. 
* One of my most rewarding projects I worked on was a paper that suggested tax reform proposals that paired a carbon tax with other progressive tax reforms, such as changes to the EITC and CTC, to achieve both equity and climate goals.
