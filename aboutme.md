Hello! I am currently pursuing my Masters of Public Policy (MPP) at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy at the University of Virginia. My areas of interest include the social safety net and anti-poverty programs, environmental policy, and state and local budgeting. Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as an economic policy research associate, working on projects related to paid family and medical leave, carbon taxation, economic mobility, and open-source microsimulation modeling of tax policy. I received my B.A. in Economics and Sustainable Development from Columbia University. Upon graduation, I hope to use my skills to analyze and advocate for equitable, evidence-based, policy at the state and local level.


### My story

I was born and raised on Long Island, NY. During my undergraduate years, I ran cross country and track and field. Off of the track, I found a passion for social science research when I spent a summer in Menonomie, WI researching lake pollution and toxic algae blooms in the Red Cedar Watershed community. Over the next few years, I explored a variety of policy projects in various research assistant positions— from corporate social responsibility, to advancing paid family and medical leave policies, to progressive carbon and welfare tax reforms, to gender analysis in the Phillippines. I've been fortunate to work with incredibly talented researchers and professionals as I explore my own policy interests.

In 2020 I decided to pursue my MPP at Batten in order to help me pursue my goal of becoming a policy analyst. So, here I am! In my free time, I enjoy running, crosswording, tutoring first graders, and eating dessert.
